"""
Metrics module — compute return-based metrics on price data.

>>> Partner B owns this module. <<<

Same layout as ingest.py: each function has a docstring (the contract) and
TODO comments telling you how to implement it.

You are DONE with this module when this runs green:

    pytest tests/test_metrics.py -v

Do not edit tests/test_metrics.py.

Read  max_drawdown  at the bottom of this file BEFORE you write your own
functions — it is already implemented, and it shows you the pattern to follow.

def daily_returns(prices):
    """
    Compute daily simple returns from a price series.

        r_t = (p_t - p_{t-1}) / p_{t-1}

    The first row has no previous price → it comes out as NaN. Drop it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prices : pandas.Series
        Price series (any index).

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Series
        Daily returns. Length is  len(prices) - 1  after dropping the leading NaN.

    ----------
